# Installation

### Composer

Until the package is on packagist, you will have to add the following to the composer.json file

    :::json
    "repositories": [
    	{
    		"type": "git",
    		"url": "git@bitbucket.org/stef-horner/documentor.git"
    	}
    ],

then you can require

    "tlr/documentor": "dev-develop"

as normal.

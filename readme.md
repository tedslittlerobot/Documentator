### Composer

To install on composer...

Until the package is on packagist, you will have to add the following to the composer.json file

```json
"repositories": [
	{
		"type": "git",
		"url": "git@github.com:tedslittlerobot/Documentator.git"
	}
],
```

then you can require

    "tlr/documentor": "dev-develop"

as normal.
